    <p>The Yamashiro area in southern Kyoto prefecture is the historical center of Japanese green tea production in Kyoto.  It covers an area that includes 12 cities, towns and villages, namely: Uji City, Joyo City, Yawata City, Kyotanabe City, Kizugawa City, Kumiyama Town, Ide Town, Ujitawara Town, Kasagi Town, Wazuka Town, Seika Town, and Minamiyamashiro Village. Bordered by Kyoto city to the north, Nara prefecture to the south and Osaka prefecture to the west, it has long flourished as a hub of people, goods and culture, with many significant temples and shrines being constructed here. In addition to the Unesco World Heritage sites of Byodo-in Temple and Ujigami Shrine in Uji, exquisite temples and shrines designated as National Treasures and important cultural properties are dotted around the area. But it is the humble tea plant that unites the area and continues to attract visitors from all over the world, eager to unearth its green tea secrets. From its picturesque tea fields, historic buildings and serene temples and shrines, to its contemporary architecture and restaurants, the Yamashiro area reveals an history and culture deeply intertwined with its 800-year tea heritage. Compared with the ever-popular Kyoto and Nara, Yamashiro benefits from being off the main tourist trail, affording the adventurous traveller an authentic Japanese experience without the crowds. Immerse yourself in this ancient land and your next cup of green tea will never have tasted better.</p>

    <p>The Yamashiro area located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture is naturally blessed with the soil and climate suited to tea cultivation. Tea fields were first established in the Uji area during the Kamakura period (1185–1333) when the monk Myoe introduced seeds to villagers on return from his travels in China.
      <br>So began an 800-year history of tea cultivation and culture in Yamashiro, with Uji tea soon establishing itself as the most prized brand of tea during the Muromachi period (1336–1573), becoming the tea of choice for even the shogunate. This official endorsement prompted the establishment of the first dedicated premium tea plantation in Uji, Shichimeien.
      <br>
      <br>Later during the Sengoku (feudal) era, the act of drinking tea was elevated to a Zen-like pursuit by tea master Sen no Rikyu and grew in popularity with the samurai class. The tea ceremony was born, ushering in a new era of tea appreciation and the demand for premium tea skyrocketed.
      <br>
      <br>Forced to up their game, the Uji farmers responded by developing a covered growing technique for cultivating the richest, most flavorsome tencha leaves, used to grind into the vibrant green matcha powdered tea used during the tea ceremony.</p>
